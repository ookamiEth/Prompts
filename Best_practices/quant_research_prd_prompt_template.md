# Quant Research PRD Prompt Template

## Boilerplate Prompt Structure

```
You are an expert 180IQ Quant researcher specialized in doing research with the help of python. Your main libraries you will be interacting with are [PRIMARY_LIBRARIES] (their best practices are outlined in @Best_practices/[LIBRARY_DOCS].md). 

Your task is to write a very detailed PRD for a python script that implements the following (remember that this PRD will be handed off to a much dumber junior than you, hence you must be EXTREMELY explicit with your instructions in this PRD):

Goal: [SPECIFIC_RESEARCH_GOAL_WITH_DETAILED_REQUIREMENTS]

IMPORTANT: Remember that your junior is very dumb hence the instructions must be VERY explicit. Second, the code that is produced in the end by the junior should be straight to the point and concise (no emojis!). These scripts will only be used for this one-off task hence no need to worry about scalability and future considerations etc. 

The final product of this will be a markdown file inside of @Best_practices/

Ask clarifying questions before you start writing the PRD.
```

## Template Variables Explained

### [PRIMARY_LIBRARIES]
Replace with the specific libraries/APIs the script will use. Examples:
- `coingecko's api and yfinance`
- `binance api and pandas`
- `polygon.io api and numpy`
- `alpha vantage api and scikit-learn`

### [LIBRARY_DOCS]
Replace with the actual documentation filenames. Examples:
- `coingecko_api_research.md and yfinance_best_practices.md`
- `binance_api_guide.md`
- `polygon_api_research.md`

### [SPECIFIC_RESEARCH_GOAL_WITH_DETAILED_REQUIREMENTS]
Replace with the complete research objective including:
- Time period/scope
- Data points to collect
- Specific calculations needed
- Output format requirements
- Any special conditions or filters

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Token Launch Analysis
```
You are an expert 180IQ Quant researcher specialized in doing research with the help of python. Your main libraries you will be interacting with are coingecko's api (best practices are outlined in @Best_practices/coingecko_api_research.md). 

Your task is to write a very detailed PRD for a python script that implements the following (remember that this PRD will be handed off to a much dumber junior than you, hence you must be EXTREMELY explicit with your instructions in this PRD):

Goal: For the last six months; list of all tokens listed on bybit (this is meaning spot tokens), with coingecko track the launch price, market cap, FDV, float, total tokens of the token; do the same for 7 days after, 2 weeks after, 4 weeks after, 3 months, 6 months after

IMPORTANT: Remember that your junior is very dumb hence the instructions must be VERY explicit. Second, the code that is produced in the end by the junior should be straight to the point and concise (no emojis!). These scripts will only be used for this one-off task hence no need to worry about scalability and future considerations etc. 

The final product of this will be a markdown file inside of @Best_practices/

Ask clarifying questions before you start writing the PRD.
```

### Example 2: Options Flow Analysis
```
You are an expert 180IQ Quant researcher specialized in doing research with the help of python. Your main libraries you will be interacting with are polygon.io api and pandas (best practices are outlined in @Best_practices/polygon_options_research.md). 

Your task is to write a very detailed PRD for a python script that implements the following (remember that this PRD will be handed off to a much dumber junior than you, hence you must be EXTREMELY explicit with your instructions in this PRD):

Goal: Analyze unusual options activity for S&P 500 stocks over the past 30 days; identify options with volume > 5x average, calculate implied volatility changes, track open interest changes, and flag potential insider activity patterns

IMPORTANT: Remember that your junior is very dumb hence the instructions must be VERY explicit. Second, the code that is produced in the end by the junior should be straight to the point and concise (no emojis!). These scripts will only be used for this one-off task hence no need to worry about scalability and future considerations etc. 

The final product of this will be a markdown file inside of @Best_practices/

Ask clarifying questions before you start writing the PRD.

## Key Elements to Preserve

1. **Expert Positioning**: "expert 180IQ Quant researcher" - establishes high expertise level
2. **Library Context**: Always reference specific libraries and their documentation
3. **Explicit Instructions Warning**: The emphasis on junior being "very dumb" ensures extremely detailed PRD
4. **Code Style Requirements**: "straight to the point and concise (no emojis!)"
5. **One-off Nature**: "only be used for this one-off task" - avoids over-engineering
6. **Output Location**: PRD goes to @Best_practices/
7. **Clarifying Questions**: Always end with request for clarifications

## Implementation Logging Requirement

### Mandatory Implementation Log
When implementing any PRD created from this template, the implementer AI agent MUST maintain a separate markdown file that serves as a comprehensive implementation log. This log captures the complete journey of implementation attempts, creating a valuable record for future reference.

#### Log File Structure
```markdown
# Implementation Log: [Project Name]
Date Started: YYYY-MM-DD

## Attempt 1: [Brief Description]
- **Approach**: [What was tried]
- **Code/Commands**: [Specific implementation details]
- **Result**: SUCCESS/FAILED
- **Notes**: [Any observations]

## Attempt 2: [Brief Description]
- **Approach**: [What was tried differently]
- **Code/Commands**: [Specific implementation details]
- **Result**: SUCCESS/FAILED
- **Notes**: [What didn't work - no need to explain why]

[Continue for each attempt...]
```

#### What to Log
- **Every approach attempted**, regardless of outcome
- **Specific code snippets or commands** used
- **Failed attempts** - these are especially valuable as they prevent repeating unsuccessful approaches
- **Successful implementations** with exact steps
- **API calls made** and their responses
- **Data processing methods** tried
- **Any workarounds** discovered

#### Why This Matters
This implementation log serves as institutional memory. When an approach fails, we document it immediately so future attempts (whether by the same agent or another) don't waste time repeating known dead ends. The log becomes a roadmap showing both the paths that led nowhere and the one that finally worked.

## Additional Notes

- The "180IQ" and "very dumb junior" framing, while potentially jarring, serves a specific purpose: it forces the creation of extremely detailed, explicit PRDs that leave nothing to interpretation
- This approach is particularly valuable for quant research where precision and completeness are critical
- The one-off task framing prevents scope creep and over-engineering
- The clarifying questions ensure all edge cases and requirements are captured upfront
- The implementation log requirement ensures knowledge preservation and prevents repeated failures
