## Quick Start

If you're new to Polars, start with [Performance & Large Dataset Focus](polars_performance_and_large_datasets.md) to understand the core concepts, then move to [Polars-Pandas Integration](polars_pandas_integration.md) to learn how to integrate with your existing pandas workflows.

For experienced users, jump directly to [Quantitative Research Specific Content](polars_quantitative_research.md) or [Advanced Techniques](polars_advanced_techniques.md) for specialized patterns.

## Essential Patterns Quick Reference

```python
# 1. Always start with lazy evaluation
df = pl.scan_parquet("data.parquet")  # Not pl.read_parquet()

# 2. Filter early and often
df = (
    pl.scan_parquet("large_data.parquet")
    .filter(pl.col("symbol") == "AAPL")          # Most selective first
    .filter(pl.col("date") >= "2020-01-01")     # Then date filters
    .filter(pl.col("volume") > 1000000)         # Then less selective filters
)

# 3. Use streaming for large datasets
result = df.collect(streaming=True)

# 4. Convert to Pandas only for visualization/analysis
plot_data = polars_result.to_pandas()
```

## Target Audience

This guide is designed for quantitative researchers, data scientists, and financial analysts who:
- Work with large datasets (GB to hundreds of GB)
- Need maximum performance for data processing
- Want to integrate Polars with existing pandas/numpy workflows
- Require production-ready, robust data processing solutions

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Familiarity with data analysis concepts
- Some experience with pandas (helpful but not required)
- Understanding of quantitative finance concepts (for QR-specific sections)
