# Summary

Largest on-chain venue for trading perps directly from your Solana wallet.

# Pros

- Very convenient as you can trade straight from you wallet
- You can use almost any coin you own as margin

# Cons

- Fees are slightly on the pricey side
- Only the major three assets are available to trade; BTC, ETH, SOL
- You will need to sign each transaction with your wallet and it will consume some SOL as gas
- Transaction speeds take about 3 seconds depending on the state of the network
- Network congestion may occur when the chain is busy
