# Overview

Aster is the result of a merger of two perp dexes from the BSC ecosystem. They boast CEX level liquidity and have a wide range of features usually only supported on CEXes while also offering unique/experimental offerings their very own funding-arb stablecoin like USDe. Aster is also providing the perp trading backend for pancakeswap([link](https://x.com/Aster_DEX/status/1927681299399266466)).

# Pros

- Binance level liquidity
- Advanced order types like FOC, IOC, RPI
- Grid orders(automated and manual)
- Yield-bearing stablecoin can be used as collateral
- Multi-asset collateral

# Cons

- UX is still a bit clunky
