# **Summary**

Variational Omni offers zero fee trading on a wide range of assets, with [500+ liquid pairs](https://omni.variational.io/markets) currently listed. Liquidity is powered by a [vertically integrated market making desk](https://docs.variational.io/omni/the-omni-liquidity-provider-olp) run by quants on the Variational team. All trades are conducted via a [Request-for-Quote (RFQ)](https://docs.variational.io/variational-protocol/key-concepts/trading-via-rfq) flow; there are no orderbooks on the platform.

[Founders have 8+ years of market making experience](https://docs.variational.io/core-contributors) each, and [previously sold their hedge fund to Digital Currency Group/Genesis Trading](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/20/genesis-trading-acquires-quant-investment-firm-qu-capital).

The platform is currently in private beta and requires a referral code from an existing user to access.

# **Pros**

- No fees.
- Wider range of assets than any other DEX; 500+ liquid pairs.
- Gasless deposits and trading.
- Usually the cheapest place to trade in size due to zero fees + vertically integrated MM that aggregates liquidity from CEXs, DEXs, and on-chain pools.

# **Cons**

- Relies on [incentive alignment with platform liquidity provider](https://docs.variational.io/omni/the-omni-liquidity-provider-olp#olps-incentive-design) for continually tight spreads.
- For HFT strategies, RFQ trading is usually inferior to orderbooks.
- Still in private beta; requires referral code from an existing user.
- No API currently available.

# **Oppotunities**

- As of July 2025, the team has not yet launched a points program or any incentives. However, the founder has [committed to doing incentives](https://x.com/variational_lvs/status/1877085082789236838) on mainnet and the platform currently [has a leaderboard](https://omni.variational.io/leaderboard) with rankings by PnL and volume.
- The team has committed to distributing “[approximately 50% of the tokens to the community.](https://docs.variational.io/token/usdvar)”
