# FAQ

## 1. What is a Perpetual DEX (Perp DEX)?

A Perp DEX is a **decentralized exchange** that supports perpetual futures contracts‚Äîderivatives with no fixed expiration date. Instead of trusting a centralized custodian with your funds, you retain full control of your private keys using a Web3 wallet (e.g., [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), or [Rabby](https://rabby.io/)). Perp DEXes allow traders to go **long or short** on various assets with leverage, just like a centralized futures platform, but with **on-chain transparency** and **self-custody**.

## 2. How Does It Compare to a CEX?

- **Ownership of Funds**: On a DEX, you keep your private keys. CEXes typically hold your funds, which adds counterparty risk.
- **No KYC**: Most Perp DEXes **do not require Know Your Customer (KYC)** procedures since they operate via permissionless smart contracts.
- **Transparency**: Perp DEXes are generally **fully on-chain**, so anyone can verify balances and trades. CEXes have historically had opaque ledgers‚Äîone infamous example is the **FTX collapse**, which involved hidden liabilities and effectively a ‚Äúbank run‚Äù when users withdrew en masse.
- **No Gas Fees on Trades**: Many modern DEXes operate on **layer 2** solutions or custom chains, drastically reducing or eliminating gas fees for trading.
- **Performance & Liquidity**: Although CEXes often still have an edge in liquidity, DEX tech has **improved vastly** in recent years. Some offer near-instant finality and high throughput, making them comparable to a CEX experience.
- **Forced Transparency**: As DEXes gained popularity, CEXes responded by introducing ‚Äúproof of reserves‚Äù pages to show they hold enough assets to cover withdrawals. DEXes, by design, offer on-chain verifiability from the start.

## 3. Do I Need a Web3 Wallet?

Yes, in most cases you‚Äôll need a **Web3 wallet** such as [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Phantom](https://phantom.app/), or [Rabby](https://rabby.io/) to interact directly with the DEX‚Äôs smart contracts. However, many Perp DEXes now provide simpler **email or social logins** (custodial or semi-custodial solutions), which lower the barrier to entry if you‚Äôre not ready to manage your own wallet keys.

## 4. Where Do You Source Your Metrics (Volume, TVL, OI, etc.)?

We gather metrics from **on-chain data providers** (e.g., DeFiLlama) and **individual exchange APIs**, which provide volume, TVL, OI, and other stats. Our goal is to consolidate this data and present it in a transparent, side-by-side comparison.

## 5. How Often Is the Data Updated?

The data on our site is updated **once a day**. We run automated scripts to fetch fresh numbers and provide the most accurate info possible.

## 6. What Does TVL (Total Value Locked) and OI (Open Interest) Represent?

- **TVL**: The total amount of assets locked or staked within a DEX protocol. A high TVL often indicates greater liquidity and community trust. Because the funds are on-chain, you can verify these balances in real time.
- **OI**: The total notional value of all open trades on a platform. Higher OI can suggest robust trading activity and deep liquidity, but it also indicates the level of leverage and risk in the market.

**Why This Matters for Safety**

A DEX with high TVL and OI typically has **strong liquidity**, which can reduce slippage and market impact when trading. It may also reflect that many users trust the platform‚Äôs smart contracts and security measures. However, **always do your own research**, as not all DEXes employ the same risk management or auditing standards.

## 7. What Are Maker and Taker Fees? (And How Do Rebates Work?)

- **Maker Fee**: Charged when you place orders that don‚Äôt fill immediately (adding liquidity). Some DEXes incentivize this with a **rebate**‚Äîin other words, they actually pay you for providing liquidity.
- **Taker Fee**: Charged when your order matches immediately (removing liquidity). Taker fees are generally higher than maker fees because you‚Äôre consuming existing liquidity from the order book.
- **Rebates**: If a platform offers maker rebates, a portion of fees goes back to the maker. This encourages more liquidity provision, which helps all users experience less slippage.

## 8. What Are Vaults?

Vaults let users automate or copy specific trading strategies:

- **Copy-Trading Vaults**: Users deposit funds to follow a strategy or mimic a professional trader. Profits (and losses) are distributed proportionally among vault participants.
- **LP Vaults**: Some DEXes offer liquidity provider (LP) vaults that supply liquidity to the platform. In return, **vault participants earn fees** from trades and liquidations. Historically, these vaults can generate good returns, but they come with inherent risks such as drawdowns caused by those exploiting the LP pool or traders on the platform winning large sums.

## 9. What Is Isolated, Cross, and Portfolio Margin?

- **Isolated Margin**: Each position‚Äôs margin is confined to a set amount of collateral. If a trade goes wrong, your losses are limited to that specific collateral.
- **Cross Margin**: Your entire account balance (or wallet balance, depending on the platform) acts as collateral for all positions. While this can reduce the risk of immediate liquidation for any single position, it also means your total balance is exposed if trades move against you.
- **Portfolio Margin**: A more advanced model where margin requirements are based on your overall portfolio risk, rather than individual positions. This can be more capital efficient but might be complex for newer traders.

## 10. What Are the Potential Risks and How Do I Choose a Safe DEX?

1. **Smart Contract Risk**: Look for DEXes with robust audits, bug bounty programs, and a track record of no exploits.
2. **Liquidity Risk**: Low liquidity can lead to slippage and volatile price movements when opening or closing positions.
3. **Governance & Team**: A known, reputable team or a strong DAO community can instill confidence.
4. **Transparency**: Check if metrics (TVL, volume, reserves) are verifiable on-chain.
5. **User Protection**: Some DEXes have insurance funds or backstop liquidity providers for extreme market events.
    
    Always cross-reference data and keep an eye on social channels for any red flags or announcements of smart contract issues.
    

## 11. What About New DEXes?

New DEXes often roll out **points programs** or airdrops to bootstrap liquidity and user adoption. Trading on these platforms can be lucrative if they distribute tokens to early users. However:

## 12. Is KYC Required, and Are There Geographic Restrictions?

- **No KYC**: Many Perp DEXes **do not require Know Your Customer (KYC)** procedures since they operate via permissionless smart contracts.
- **Blocked Regions**: Some DEXes may restrict or geofence access for users in certain jurisdictions (e.g., the United States).
- **No Workarounds**: We **do not advise** using VPNs or other workarounds to bypass these regional restrictions. Always check and comply with the local regulations in your area.
