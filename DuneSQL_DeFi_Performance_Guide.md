## Understanding Dune's Data Architecture

### The Three-Tier Architecture: Raw ‚Üí Decoded ‚Üí Curated

Dune organizes blockchain data into three distinct layers, and understanding this is **CRITICAL** for writing performant queries:

#### 1. Raw Data Layer (Lowest Performance)
```sql
-- RAW TABLES (USE SPARINGLY)
ethereum.blocks           -- Block metadata
ethereum.transactions     -- Transaction details  
ethereum.logs            -- Event logs (encoded)
ethereum.traces          -- Internal transaction traces
```

**When to use:** Only when you need data that hasn't been decoded yet, or when you're doing very specific low-level blockchain analysis.

**Performance Impact:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **SLOW** - These tables are massive and require manual decoding.

#### 2. Decoded Data Layer (High Performance)
```sql
-- DECODED TABLES (PREFER THESE)
uniswap_v3_ethereum.pool_evt_swap     -- Specific contract events
aave_v2_ethereum.lendingpool_call_*   -- Contract function calls
erc20_ethereum.evt_transfer           -- All ERC20 transfers
```

**When to use:** 95% of your DeFi analysis should use these tables.

**Performance Impact:** ‚úÖ **FAST** - Pre-processed, indexed, and human-readable.

#### 3. Curated Data Layer (Highest Performance)
```sql
-- CURATED TABLES (FASTEST)
dex.trades              -- All DEX trades across protocols
nft.trades             -- All NFT marketplace trades
tokens.erc20           -- Token metadata and prices
prices.usd             -- Price feeds
```

**When to use:** When you need cross-protocol analysis or standardized metrics.

**Performance Impact:** üöÄ **FASTEST** - Optimized, aggregated, and ready for analysis.

### **GOLDEN RULE #1: Always Use the Highest Layer Possible**

```sql
-- ‚ùå WRONG - Using raw logs (slow)
SELECT * FROM ethereum.logs 
WHERE contract_address = 0xa0b86a33e6a8e0b57c5e678b15dce2ffec3e9de5

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT - Using decoded table (fast)
SELECT * FROM uniswap_v2_ethereum.pair_evt_swap
WHERE contract_address = 0xa0b86a33e6a8e0b57c5e678b15dce2ffec3e9de5

-- üöÄ BEST - Using curated table (fastest)
SELECT * FROM dex.trades 
WHERE project = 'uniswap' 
  AND version = '2'
  AND pool_address = 0xa0b86a33e6a8e0b57c5e678b15dce2ffec3e9de5
```

---

## Core DeFi Tables and Data Sources

### Essential Curated Tables for DeFi Analysis

#### 1. `dex.trades` - The Most Important Table for DeFi

This table contains **ALL** decentralized exchange trades across **40+ blockchains** and **100+ protocols**.

**Table Structure:**
```sql
SELECT 
    blockchain,           -- Chain where trade occurred
    project,             -- DEX protocol (uniswap, sushiswap, etc.)
    version,             -- Protocol version (v2, v3, etc.)
    block_date,          -- Date of trade (indexed - FAST filtering)
    block_time,          -- Timestamp of trade (indexed - FAST filtering)
    token_bought_symbol, -- Symbol of token purchased
    token_sold_symbol,   -- Symbol of token sold
    token_bought_amount, -- Amount purchased (raw units)
    token_sold_amount,   -- Amount sold (raw units)
    amount_usd,          -- USD value of trade
    token_bought_address,-- Contract address of bought token
    token_sold_address,  -- Contract address of sold token
    taker,               -- Address executing the trade
    maker,               -- Address providing liquidity
    project_contract_address, -- DEX router/contract address
    tx_hash,             -- Transaction hash
    evt_index            -- Event index within transaction
FROM dex.trades
```

**Critical Performance Tips:**
- **ALWAYS filter by `blockchain`** when analyzing single chains
- **Use `block_date` for date ranges** (much faster than `block_time`)
- **Filter by `project`** to focus on specific DEXs
- **Use `amount_usd`** for volume analysis (pre-calculated)

#### 2. `dex_aggregator.trades` - Simplified Aggregator View

Shows high-level trades through DEX aggregators (1inch, 0x, etc.), complementing `dex.trades`.

**Key Difference:**
- One row in `dex_aggregator.trades` = User's intended trade
- Multiple rows in `dex.trades` = Individual steps/pools used

#### 3. `tokens.erc20` - Token Metadata and Prices

```sql
SELECT 
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    decimals,           -- CRITICAL for amount calculations
    name,
    price_latest,       -- Most recent price
    price_latest_time   -- When price was last updated
FROM tokens.erc20
```

#### 4. `prices.usd` - Historical Price Data

```sql
SELECT 
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    minute,             -- Minute-level precision
    price,              -- USD price at that minute
    decimals
FROM prices.usd
```

### **GOLDEN RULE #2: Always Join with Token Metadata**

```sql
-- ‚ùå WRONG - No token info, amounts are in raw units
SELECT 
    token_bought_amount,
    token_sold_amount
FROM dex.trades

-- ‚úÖ CORRECT - Join with token metadata for readable amounts
SELECT 
    trades.token_bought_amount / power(10, bought_token.decimals) as bought_amount_formatted,
    trades.token_sold_amount / power(10, sold_token.decimals) as sold_amount_formatted,
    bought_token.symbol as bought_symbol,
    sold_token.symbol as sold_symbol
FROM dex.trades trades
LEFT JOIN tokens.erc20 bought_token 
    ON trades.token_bought_address = bought_token.contract_address 
    AND trades.blockchain = bought_token.blockchain
LEFT JOIN tokens.erc20 sold_token 
    ON trades.token_sold_address = sold_token.contract_address 
    AND trades.blockchain = sold_token.blockchain
```

## Smart Contract Data Analysis Fundamentals

### Understanding Contract Decoding

Smart contracts on Ethereum (and EVM chains) store their logic as bytecode. To make this human-readable, Dune uses **Application Binary Interfaces (ABIs)** to decode:

1. **Function calls** ‚Üí `_call_` tables
2. **Events** ‚Üí `_evt_` tables

### Decoded Table Naming Convention

```
[projectname_blockchain].[contractName]_[type]_[functionOrEventName]
```

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Uniswap V3 Pool swap events
uniswap_v3_ethereum.pool_evt_swap

-- Aave lending pool borrow function calls
aave_v2_ethereum.lendingpool_call_borrow

-- Compound cToken mint events
compound_v2_ethereum.cerc20_evt_mint
```

### **CRITICAL LIMITATION: State Data is NOT Available**

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Smart contract state data (storage variables) is **NOT** available on Dune.

**What's Available:**
- Function calls that resulted in transactions
- Events emitted during transactions
- External function calls between contracts

**What's NOT Available:**
- `view` or `pure` function calls made locally
- Contract storage variables
- Balances stored in contract state (unless emitted as events)

### Finding the Right Decoded Tables

#### Method 1: Use the Schema Browser
In Dune's interface, navigate to the schema browser and search for:
- Project name (e.g., "uniswap", "aave", "compound")
- Contract address
- Function or event name

#### Method 2: Query the contracts table
```sql
-- Find all decoded contracts for a project
SELECT DISTINCT 
    namespace,
    name,
    address
FROM ethereum.contracts 
WHERE namespace LIKE '%uniswap%'
```

#### Method 3: Search by contract address
```sql
-- Find decoded tables for a specific contract
SELECT DISTINCT 
    namespace,
    name
FROM ethereum.contracts 
WHERE address = 0x1f98431c8ad98523631ae4a59f267346ea31f984
```

### **GOLDEN RULE #3: Prefer Decoded Events Over Function Calls**

Events are more reliable and performant than function calls because:
- Events are indexed and searchable
- Events represent state changes
- Function calls may not complete successfully

```sql
-- ‚ùå SLOWER - Function call tables
SELECT * FROM uniswap_v3_ethereum.pool_call_swap

-- ‚úÖ FASTER - Event tables  
SELECT * FROM uniswap_v3_ethereum.pool_evt_swap
```

---

## Query Performance Optimization Principles

### 1. Index-Aware Filtering

Dune's tables are indexed on specific columns. **Always filter on indexed columns first.**

**Primary Indexes:**
- `block_time` / `block_date` - Temporal filtering
- `block_number` - Block-based filtering  
- `blockchain` - Chain filtering
- `contract_address` - Contract-specific filtering

```sql
-- ‚úÖ FAST - Uses indexes
SELECT * FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'           -- Indexed
  AND block_date >= '2024-01-01'        -- Indexed
  AND project = 'uniswap'               -- Potentially indexed
  AND amount_usd > 1000

-- ‚ùå SLOW - No index usage
SELECT * FROM dex.trades
WHERE token_bought_symbol = 'USDC'      -- Not indexed
  AND taker = 0x123...                  -- Not indexed
```

### 2. Date Range Optimization

**Use `block_date` for day-level analysis:**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ FAST - Uses date partitioning
WHERE block_date >= '2024-01-01' 
  AND block_date < '2024-02-01'

-- ‚ùå SLOWER - Requires timestamp scanning
WHERE block_time >= '2024-01-01' 
  AND block_time < '2024-02-01'
```

**Use `block_time` only when you need hour/minute precision:**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ ACCEPTABLE - When you need hourly data
WHERE block_time >= timestamp '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
  AND block_time < timestamp '2024-01-01 01:00:00'
```

### 3. Blockchain Filtering Strategy

**ALWAYS filter by blockchain early in cross-chain tables:**

```sql
-- ‚úÖ FAST - Blockchain filter applied first
SELECT 
    project,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'           -- Filter first!
  AND block_date >= '2024-01-01'
  AND project IN ('uniswap', 'sushiswap')
GROUP BY project

-- ‚ùå SLOW - No blockchain filter
SELECT 
    blockchain,
    project,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume
FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_date >= '2024-01-01'
  AND project IN ('uniswap', 'sushiswap')  -- Scans all chains!
GROUP BY blockchain, project
```

### 4. Aggregation Optimization

**Use pre-aggregated columns when available:**

```sql
-- ‚úÖ FAST - Uses pre-calculated USD amounts
SELECT 
    project,
    SUM(amount_usd) as total_volume_usd
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
GROUP BY project

-- ‚ùå SLOW - Manual price calculation
SELECT 
    project,
    SUM(token_bought_amount * p.price) as total_volume_usd
FROM dex.trades t
LEFT JOIN prices.usd p 
    ON t.token_bought_address = p.contract_address
    AND t.blockchain = p.blockchain
    AND date_trunc('minute', t.block_time) = p.minute
WHERE t.blockchain = 'ethereum'
GROUP BY project
```

### **GOLDEN RULE #4: Filter Early, Aggregate Late**

Structure your queries to apply the most selective filters first:

```sql
-- ‚úÖ OPTIMAL QUERY STRUCTURE
WITH filtered_trades AS (
    SELECT *
    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'        -- Most selective filter first
      AND block_date >= '2024-01-01'    -- Time filter second
      AND project = 'uniswap'           -- Project filter third
      AND version = '3'                 -- Version filter fourth
      AND amount_usd > 1000              -- Amount filter last
)
SELECT 
    token_bought_symbol,
    token_sold_symbol,
    COUNT(*) as trade_count,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM filtered_trades
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY volume_usd DESC
```

```

### 2. Cross-DEX Arbitrage Analysis

```sql
-- Find arbitrage opportunities across DEXs
WITH price_comparison AS (
    SELECT 
        block_time,
        token_bought_address,

    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
      AND block_date = current_date
      AND token_bought_address = 0xa0b86a33e6a8e0b57c5e678b15dce2ffec3e9de5  -- USDC
      AND token_sold_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2   -- WETH
      AND amount_usd > 10000
),

    (p2.max_price - p1.min_price) / p1.min_price * 100 as arbitrage_opportunity_pct
FROM price_ranges p1
JOIN price_ranges p2 
    ON p1.minute = p2.minute 
    AND p1.project < p2.project  -- Avoid duplicate pairs
WHERE (p2.max_price - p1.min_price) / p1.min_price > 0.005  -- > 0.5% difference
ORDER BY arbitrage_opportunity_pct DESC
```

### 3. MEV and Front-Running Detection

## Token Movement and Transfer Analysis

### Understanding Token Transfer Data

Token transfers are recorded as events in smart contracts. The most important tables:

1. **`erc20_ethereum.evt_transfer`** - All ERC20 transfers
2. **`tokens.transfers`** - Curated, cross-chain transfers  
3. **Individual token tables** - e.g., `usdc_ethereum.evt_transfer`

### **GOLDEN RULE #5: Use Specific Token Tables When Possible**

```sql
-- ‚úÖ FASTEST - Specific token table
SELECT * FROM usdc_ethereum.evt_transfer
WHERE evt_block_time >= '2024-01-01'

-- ‚úÖ FAST - Filtered general table  
SELECT * FROM erc20_ethereum.evt_transfer
WHERE contract_address = 0xa0b86a33e6a8e0b57c5e678b15dce2ffec3e9de5
  AND evt_block_time >= '2024-01-01'

-- ‚ùå SLOW - Unfiltered general table
SELECT * FROM erc20_ethereum.evt_transfer
WHERE evt_block_time >= '2024-01-01'
```

### 1. Large Transfer Detection

```sql
-- Find whale transactions and unusual movements
WITH large_transfers AS (
    SELECT 
        evt_block_time,
        evt_tx_hash,
        "from",
        "to",
        value / 1e6 as amount_usdc,  -- USDC has 6 decimals
        value
    FROM usdc_ethereum.evt_transfer
    WHERE evt_block_date >= current_date - interval '7' day
      AND value >= 1000000 * 1e6  -- $1M+ transfers
),
transfer_analysis AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        -- Identify exchange addresses (simplified)
        CASE 
            WHEN "from" IN (
                0x503828976d22510aad0201ac7ec88293211d23da,  -- Coinbase
                0x28c6c06298d514db089934071355e5743bf21d60,  -- Binance
                0x21a31ee1afc51d94c2efccaa2092ad1028285549   -- Binance 2
            ) THEN 'Exchange Outflow'
            WHEN "to" IN (
                0x503828976d22510aad0201ac7ec88293211d23da,
                0x28c6c06298d514db089934071355e5743bf21d60,
                0x21a31ee1afc51d94c2efccaa2092ad1028285549
            ) THEN 'Exchange Inflow'
            ELSE 'Wallet to Wallet'
        END as transfer_type
    FROM large_transfers
)
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', evt_block_time) as day,
    transfer_type,
    COUNT(*) as transfer_count,
    SUM(amount_usdc) as total_amount_usdc,
    AVG(amount_usdc) as avg_amount_usdc,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY amount_usdc) as median_amount_usdc
FROM transfer_analysis
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY day DESC, total_amount_usdc DESC
```

### 2. Token Holder Analysis

```sql
-- Analyze token distribution and holder behavior
WITH usdc_balances AS (
    SELECT 
        "to" as holder,
        SUM(value) as total_received
    FROM usdc_ethereum.evt_transfer
    WHERE evt_block_date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY "to"
    
    UNION ALL

## Common Performance Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Using Raw Logs Instead of Decoded Tables

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```sql
-- This query will be extremely slow
SELECT * FROM ethereum.logs
WHERE contract_address = 0xa0b86a33e6a8e0b57c5e678b15dce2ffec3e9de5
  AND topic0 = 0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```sql
-- Use the decoded transfer events table
SELECT * FROM erc20_ethereum.evt_transfer
WHERE contract_address = 0xa0b86a33e6a8e0b57c5e678b15dce2ffec3e9de5
```

**Why it's faster:** Decoded tables are pre-processed, indexed, and human-readable.

### Pitfall 2: Not Filtering by Blockchain

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```sql
-- Scans ALL blockchains
SELECT project, SUM(amount_usd) FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY project
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```sql
-- Only scans Ethereum data
SELECT project, SUM(amount_usd) FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND block_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY project
```

### Pitfall 3: Inefficient Date Filtering

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```sql
-- String comparison is slow
WHERE DATE(block_time) >= '2024-01-01'
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```sql
-- Direct date comparison is fast
WHERE block_date >= '2024-01-01'
-- OR for timestamp precision:
WHERE block_time >= timestamp '2024-01-01 00:00:00'
```

### Pitfall 4: Unnecessary JOINs

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```sql
-- Joining when data is already available
SELECT 
    t.amount_usd,
    p.price
FROM dex.trades t
LEFT JOIN prices.usd p 
    ON t.token_bought_address = p.contract_address
WHERE t.blockchain = 'ethereum'
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```sql
-- Use pre-calculated USD amounts
SELECT amount_usd
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
```

### Pitfall 5: Inefficient Aggregations

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```sql
-- Calculating prices manually
SELECT 
    AVG(token_bought_amount * price_usd) as avg_trade_value
FROM dex.trades
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```sql
-- Use pre-calculated values
SELECT AVG(amount_usd) as avg_trade_value
FROM dex.trades
```

### Pitfall 6: Not Using LIMIT for Exploration

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```sql
-- Returns millions of rows
SELECT * FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```sql
-- Always limit when exploring
SELECT * FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
LIMIT 1000
```

### Pitfall 7: Inefficient Window Functions

**‚ùå WRONG:**
```sql
-- Inefficient partitioning
SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY amount_usd DESC) as rn
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
```

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
```sql
-- Partition by relevant columns
SELECT 
    *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
        PARTITION BY project, block_date 
        ORDER BY amount_usd DESC
    ) as rn
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND block_date >= '2024-01-01'
```

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### 1. Using Materialized Views for Complex Calculations

For frequently-used complex queries, create materialized views to cache results:

```sql
-- Example: Create a materialized view for daily DEX metrics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_dex_metrics AS
WITH daily_stats AS (
    SELECT 
        blockchain,
        project,
        version,
        block_date,
        COUNT(*) as trade_count,
        COUNT(DISTINCT taker) as unique_traders,
        SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd,
        AVG(amount_usd) as avg_trade_size,
        COUNT(DISTINCT token_bought_address) as unique_tokens_bought,
        COUNT(DISTINCT token_sold_address) as unique_tokens_sold
    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE block_date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
)
SELECT 
    *,
    volume_usd / SUM(volume_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY blockchain, block_date) * 100 as market_share_pct,
    LAG(volume_usd, 1) OVER (
        PARTITION BY blockchain, project, version 
        ORDER BY block_date
    ) as prev_day_volume
FROM daily_stats;

-- Use the materialized view for fast analysis
SELECT 
    project,
    AVG(market_share_pct) as avg_market_share,
    AVG(volume_usd) as avg_daily_volume
FROM daily_dex_metrics
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND block_date >= current_date - interval '30' day
GROUP BY project
ORDER BY avg_daily_volume DESC;
```

### 2. Optimizing Subqueries with CTEs

Replace correlated subqueries with CTEs for better performance:

```sql
-- ‚ùå SLOW - Correlated subqueries
SELECT 
    taker,
    amount_usd,
    (SELECT AVG(amount_usd) FROM dex.trades dt2 
     WHERE dt2.taker = dt1.taker) as user_avg_trade_size
FROM dex.trades dt1
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum';

-- ‚úÖ FAST - Using CTEs
WITH user_averages AS (
    SELECT 
        taker,
        AVG(amount_usd) as avg_trade_size
    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
    GROUP BY taker
)
SELECT 
    dt.taker,
    dt.amount_usd,
    ua.avg_trade_size as user_avg_trade_size
FROM dex.trades dt
JOIN user_averages ua ON dt.taker = ua.taker
WHERE dt.blockchain = 'ethereum';
```

### 3. Efficient Pagination for Large Result Sets

When dealing with large result sets, use efficient pagination:

```sql
-- ‚úÖ EFFICIENT PAGINATION
WITH ranked_trades AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY amount_usd DESC, tx_hash) as rn
    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
      AND block_date >= current_date - interval '1' day
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_trades
WHERE rn BETWEEN 1001 AND 2000  -- Page 2 (1000 records per page)
ORDER BY rn;
```

### 4. Using UNION ALL for Conditional Logic

Instead of complex CASE statements, use UNION ALL for better performance:

```sql
-- ‚ùå SLOWER - Complex CASE statement
SELECT 
    taker,
    CASE 
        WHEN amount_usd > 100000 THEN 'Whale'
        WHEN amount_usd > 10000 THEN 'Large'
        ELSE 'Regular'
    END as trader_type,
    COUNT(*) as trade_count
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
GROUP BY 1, 2;

-- ‚úÖ FASTER - UNION ALL approach
SELECT 'Whale' as trader_type, taker, COUNT(*) as trade_count
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum' AND amount_usd > 100000
GROUP BY taker

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Large' as trader_type, taker, COUNT(*) as trade_count
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum' AND amount_usd BETWEEN 10000 AND 100000
GROUP BY taker

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Regular' as trader_type, taker, COUNT(*) as trade_count
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum' AND amount_usd < 10000
GROUP BY taker;
```

### 5. Leveraging Array Functions for Efficient Analysis

Use array aggregation for complex grouping operations:

```sql
-- Efficient multi-dimensional analysis using arrays
WITH trader_activity AS (
    SELECT 
        taker,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT project) as projects_used,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT token_bought_symbol) as tokens_bought,
        ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT token_sold_symbol) as tokens_sold,
        COUNT(*) as total_trades,
        SUM(amount_usd) as total_volume
    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
      AND block_date >= current_date - interval '30' day
    GROUP BY taker
)
SELECT 
    taker,
    CARDINALITY(projects_used) as unique_projects,
    CARDINALITY(tokens_bought) as unique_tokens_bought,
    CARDINALITY(tokens_sold) as unique_tokens_sold,
    total_trades,
    total_volume,
    -- Calculate diversity score
    (CARDINALITY(projects_used) * CARDINALITY(tokens_bought)) as diversity_score
FROM trader_activity
WHERE CARDINALITY(projects_used) >= 3  -- Active on multiple DEXs
ORDER BY diversity_score DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting and Debugging

### 1. Query Performance Diagnosis

#### Check Query Execution Statistics
After running a query, always check the execution statistics:
- Click "last run X seconds ago" in the query editor
- Look for high CPU time, memory usage, or rows scanned
- Identify bottlenecks in your query plan

#### Use EXPLAIN for Complex Queries
```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)
SELECT 
    project,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND block_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY project;
```

### 2. Common Error Messages and Solutions

#### "Query timeout" Errors
**Cause:** Query taking longer than 30 minutes to execute.
**Solutions:**
- Add more selective filters (blockchain, date range)
- Use LIMIT for exploration
- Break complex queries into smaller parts
- Use materialized views for expensive calculations

#### "Out of memory" Errors
**Cause:** Query processing too much data in memory.
**Solutions:**
- Reduce data volume with filters
- Avoid large JOINs without proper filtering
- Use streaming aggregation instead of window functions where possible

#### "Rate limit exceeded" Errors
**Cause:** Too many API calls or query executions.
**Solutions:**
- Space out your query executions
- Use scheduled queries instead of manual execution
- Optimize queries to run faster and use fewer resources

### 3. Data Quality Validation

#### Validate Token Decimals
```sql
-- Check if token decimals are correctly applied
SELECT 
    token_address,
    symbol,
    decimals,
    MIN(amount) as min_raw_amount,
    MAX(amount) as max_raw_amount,
    MIN(amount / POWER(10, decimals)) as min_formatted,
    MAX(amount / POWER(10, decimals)) as max_formatted
FROM erc20_ethereum.evt_transfer
JOIN tokens.erc20 USING (contract_address, blockchain)
WHERE evt_block_date >= current_date - interval '1' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
HAVING MAX(amount / POWER(10, decimals)) > 1e12  -- Suspiciously large amounts
```

#### Check for Missing Data
```sql
-- Identify gaps in daily data
WITH date_series AS (
    SELECT generate_series(
        date '2024-01-01',
        current_date,
        interval '1 day'
    )::date as check_date
),
daily_counts AS (
    SELECT 
        block_date,
        COUNT(*) as trade_count
    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
      AND project = 'uniswap'
    GROUP BY block_date
)
SELECT 
    ds.check_date,
    COALESCE(dc.trade_count, 0) as trades,
    CASE 
        WHEN dc.trade_count IS NULL THEN 'Missing Data'
        WHEN dc.trade_count < 1000 THEN 'Low Activity'
        ELSE 'Normal'
    END as status
FROM date_series ds
LEFT JOIN daily_counts dc ON ds.check_date = dc.block_date
WHERE ds.check_date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY ds.check_date DESC;
```

### 4. Testing and Validation Strategies

#### Sample Data Testing
Always test your queries on small datasets first:

```sql
-- Test your logic on a small sample
WITH sample_data AS (
    SELECT * FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
      AND block_date = '2024-01-15'  -- Single day
    LIMIT 10000
)
-- Your complex query logic here using sample_data
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sample_data;
```

#### Cross-Validation with Known Results
Validate your results against known benchmarks:

```sql
-- Cross-validate DEX volume with external sources
SELECT 
    block_date,
    project,
    SUM(amount_usd) as dune_volume
FROM dex.trades
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND project = 'uniswap'
  AND version = '3'
  AND block_date = '2024-01-15'  -- Known high-volume day
GROUP BY 1, 2;
-- Compare with external DEX analytics platforms
```

## Final Best Practices Summary

### The 10 Commandments of High-Performance DuneSQL

1. **Always filter by blockchain first** in cross-chain tables
2. **Use curated tables** (`dex.trades`, `tokens.erc20`) over raw data
3. **Filter by date ranges** using `block_date` for performance
4. **Leverage decoded event tables** instead of raw logs
5. **Apply the most selective filters first** in WHERE clauses
6. **Use LIMIT during query development** and testing
7. **Join on indexed columns** (addresses, block numbers, timestamps)
8. **Avoid unnecessary JOINs** when data is already available
9. **Test on small datasets** before running on full data
10. **Monitor query execution statistics** to identify bottlenecks

### Query Development Workflow

1. **Start Small:** Begin with LIMIT 1000 and basic filters
2. **Add Filters:** Progressively add blockchain, date, and project filters
3. **Build Logic:** Implement your analysis logic on the filtered dataset
4. **Optimize:** Remove LIMIT and optimize for full dataset
5. **Validate:** Cross-check results with known benchmarks
6. **Document:** Comment your query logic for future reference

### Performance Checklist

Before running any production query, verify:

- [ ] Blockchain filter applied to cross-chain tables
- [ ] Date range specified using `block_date` or `block_time`
- [ ] Most selective filters applied first
- [ ] Using highest-level data tables available
- [ ] JOINs are necessary and properly indexed
- [ ] No correlated subqueries (use CTEs instead)
- [ ] LIMIT clause during development phase
- [ ] Query execution time is reasonable (<5 minutes)
